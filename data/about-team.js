  [ "Ryan Scott",
    "Motion Graphics Artist",
    ["From a professional perspective I am most interested in three disciplines. Design, animation and logistics. For me the discipline of design is obviously a visual one and I find that it always comes first. It is the process of defining a visual intention and then stripping away the unnecessary to discover the core of an idea. It is the process of creating balance and provocation. Break down. Build up. Repeat until calm & salivating... For me animation is a spatial discipline - not a visual one. How does this move and why? How does that move in relation to this and when? It is the process of being something else. Observe and take delight from nature. Remember and emulate. And finally there is logistics. How long is this going to take? Can we make this even better? Can you do this? The answers are: forever, yes and yes. For me logistics is the process of taking art and breaking it down into quantifiable and ordered actions to execute a desired vision as rapidly as possible. It is the process of balancing two often maniacal and always opposing forces. Define constraints. Set expectations. Allow and embrace failure. Take a deep breath and jump in. When I'm at work this is me. ","When I'm not at work, I'm currently delighting in the wonder of my son and sharing this with wifey. I cycle, commensurate over past dojo days and clean up after glorious homemade meals. I take photos and nerd out over devices. I take it easy. I am grateful."],
