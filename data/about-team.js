    ["Everyone has a story.","Megan’s story is about discovery.","Her gift is the ability to find and then tell your story in a creative and memorable way while making the execution smooth and enjoyable for everyone.","Megan began communicating through music at an early age.  Violin, piano, French horn, voice and finally, classical guitar. Then, she discovered journalism, and formally learned how to tell a story. But she was gently dissuaded from the newsroom by seasoned news reporters who found her work too creative. It was the best thing that happened to her.","Megan continued to shape stories through post-production, expanding her engineering background as she went. Soon, she not only told stories, but she could tell you how the tools work. This brought a unique ability to bridge the gap between the technical and artistic components required to execute a flawless final product. Basically, Megan can talk creative and speak tech. This saves time (money), and keeps a project on track.","For Megan, defining and telling the authentic story is essential to every project. And her particular genius is putting together a team that is the perfect fit in talent and personality. It’s this synergy that makes a project go well, and keeps clients coming back.","When Megan took the helm in 2011, her vision was to take the company to the next level by focusing on, and expanding, creative capabilities. With a few key hires, she is proud to say that TMG Creative is now a world-class contender. Keep your eye on us, we’ve got more to come!"],

    ["Jack keeps everything working. Literally.","Back in the ‘90s, Jack began freelancing for TMG as Chief Engineer, where he repaired and maintained every piece of equipment – computers to broadcast VTRS to editing and graphics systems. He designed and engineered complete systems at a time when technology was rapidly changing, and staying ahead of that curve determined market success or failure more than ever. Among his many brilliant innovations was a patent for a new system to create video dubs on location, awarded to both Jack and TMG Founder, Aldo Panattoni.","Jack left TMG in 1999 to design and build a brand new facility in Texas. Though the project was a great success, Jack was homesick for the Bay Area and for TMG. Lucky us! ","We welcomed him back with open arms in 2004.","Today, in an ever more rapidly changing technological landscape, Jack keeps everything current, best-in-class, and always geared toward the primary goal: great creative.","In his spare time, Jack studies scripture, works around the house, and travels to Mexico to lend his talents to orphanages, designing water projects and infrastructure."],
