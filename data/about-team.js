    ["Everyone has a story.","Megan’s story is about discovery.","Her gift is the ability to find and then tell your story in a creative and memorable way while making the execution smooth and enjoyable for everyone.","Megan began communicating through music at an early age.  Violin, piano, French horn, voice and finally, classical guitar. Then, she discovered journalism, and formally learned how to tell a story. But she was gently dissuaded from the newsroom by seasoned news reporters who found her work too creative. It was the best thing that happened to her.","Megan continued to shape stories through post-production, expanding her engineering background as she went. Soon, she not only told stories, but she could tell you how the tools work. This brought a unique ability to bridge the gap between the technical and artistic components required to execute a flawless final product. Basically, Megan can talk creative and speak tech. This saves time (money), and keeps a project on track.","For Megan, defining and telling the authentic story is essential to every project. And her particular genius is putting together a team that is the perfect fit in talent and personality. It’s this synergy that makes a project go well, and keeps clients coming back.","When Megan took the helm in 2011, her vision was to take the company to the next level by focusing on, and expanding, creative capabilities. With a few key hires, she is proud to say that TMG Creative is now a world-class contender. Keep your eye on us, we’ve got more to come!"],

Graphic design, illustration, 3D design, animation, and compositing are all very much a part his creative process. For Ryan, the challenge of orchestrating these disciplines is his specialty.

Here, his true love has been nurtured – storytelling, and evoking emotion with music and picture – and we’re stoked to share the love!","What’s his favorite part of a project? Collaboration with the client and creative team. Building something from basic concept to final piece. Exceeding expectations. And earning the most important result: client trust.","When not at work, Patrick loves to spend time with his wife and is an adoring dad to two young children, plays music (yes, he does have a band), cycles, goes to concerts and watches movies."],
