    ["Everyone has a story.","Megan’s story is about discovery...","Her gift is the ability to find and then tell your story in a creative and memorable way while making the execution smooth and enjoyable for everyone.","Megan began communicating through music at an early age.  Violin, piano, French horn, voice and finally, classical guitar. Then, she discovered journalism, and formally learned how to tell a story. But she was gently dissuaded from the newsroom by seasoned news reporters who found her work too creative. It was the best thing that happened to her.","Megan continued to shape stories through post-production, expanding her engineering background as she went. Soon, she not only told stories, but she could tell you how the tools work. This brought a unique ability to bridge the gap between the technical and artistic components required to execute a flawless final product. Basically, Megan can talk creative and speak tech. This saves time (money), and keeps a project on track.","For Megan, defining and telling the authentic story is essential to every project. And her particular genius is putting together a team that is the perfect fit in talent and personality. It’s this synergy that makes a project go well, and keeps clients coming back.","When Megan took the helm in 2011, her vision was to take the company to the next level by focusing on, and expanding, creative capabilities. With a few key hires, she is proud to say that TMG Creative is now a world-class contender. Keep your eye on us, we’ve got more to come!"],

  [ "Ryan Scott",
    "Motion Graphics Artist",
    ["From a professional perspective, I am most interested in three disciplines. Design, animation and logistics. For me, the discipline of design is obviously a visual one and I find that it always comes first. It is the process of defining a visual intention and then stripping away the unnecessary to discover the core of an idea. It is the process of creating balance and provocation. Break down. Build up. Repeat until calm and salivating... For me, animation is a spatial discipline - not a visual one. How does this move and why? How does that move in relation to this and when? It is the process of being something else. Observe and take delight from nature. Remember and emulate. And finally, there are logistics. How long is this going to take? Can we make this even better? Can you do this? The answers are: forever, yes and yes. For me logistics are the process of taking art and breaking it down into quantifiable and ordered actions to execute a desired vision as rapidly as possible. It is the process of balancing two often maniacal and always opposing forces. Define constraints. Set expectations. Allow and embrace failure. Take a deep breath and jump in. When I'm at work, this is me. ","When I'm not at work, I'm currently delighting in the wonder of my son and sharing this with wifey. I cycle, commensurate over past dojo days and clean up after glorious homemade meals. I take photos and nerd out over devices. I take it easy. I am grateful."],
